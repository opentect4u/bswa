	  <h2>About Us</h2>
	  <p>Welcome to the official website of the Bokaro Steel Employees' (Calcutta) Co-operative Credit Society Ltd, a cornerstone in the financial and social welfare of current and former employees of the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), particularly those associated with the Bokaro Steel Plant. Established in 1979 under Registration No. 31/Cal, our society has continuously strived to empower its members through financial support, welfare initiatives, and community-building efforts. Over the years, we have evolved to meet the changing needs of our members, always guided by the principles of mutual aid, cooperation, and social responsibility.</p>

    <p>In 2023, we took a significant step forward by establishing the BOSEC Welfare Trust under the Trust Act. This trust, with its General Council comprising members and life members of the Bokaro Steel People Welfare Association, embodies our commitment to the long-term welfare of our community. The association, registered under the Societies Act with Registration No. S017807 on 28/10/2023, plays a pivotal role in representing the interests of both current and former employees of SAIL and their families.</p>

    <p>Our mission is to foster a sense of belonging and security among our members, ensuring that they have access to financial resources, social support, and opportunities for personal and professional growth. The BOSEC Welfare Trust is designed to extend these benefits to all eligible beneficiaries, including the family members of SAIL employees, making sure that no one is left behind.
    </p>

    <p>We are proud of our heritage and the role we play in the lives of our members. Our commitment to their welfare is unwavering, and we continuously strive to enhance the benefits and services we offer. As we look to the future, we remain dedicated to building a stronger, more resilient community, one that supports its members at every stage of their lives. Thank you for being a part of our journey.
